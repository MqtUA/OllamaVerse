## Implementation Plan

### Task 1: Standardize Dracula Theme Shapes
**Objective**: Make Dracula theme UI elements have identical shapes to Material Light theme

**Details**:
- Update all border radius values in Dracula theme to match Material Light (12px for most elements)
- Add missing theme definitions (CardTheme, DialogTheme, etc.)
- Ensure consistent shape properties across all UI components
- Maintain Dracula color scheme while adopting Material Light shapes

**Files to Modify**:
- `lib/theme/dracula_theme.dart` - Add missing theme definitions with consistent shapes

### Task 2: Optimize Theme Switching Performance
**Objective**: Reduce app rebuild time and improve theme switching responsiveness

**Details**:
- Implement theme caching to avoid recreation
- Use `ThemeMode` more efficiently 
- Reduce unnecessary widget rebuilds during theme changes
- Optimize MaterialApp rebuild strategy
- Add theme switching debouncing

**Files to Modify**:
- `lib/main.dart` - Optimize MaterialApp theme handling
- `lib/providers/settings_provider.dart` - Add theme caching and debouncing
- `lib/services/cache_service.dart` - Add theme cache management

### Task 3: Add State Change Animations
**Objective**: Enhance user experience with smooth animations for state changes

**Details**:
- Add theme switching transition animations
- Improve message loading animations
- Add connection status animations
- Enhance model switching animations
- Add settings change feedback animations

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `lib/widgets/animated_theme_switcher.dart` - Theme transition animations
- `lib/widgets/animated_status_indicator.dart` - Connection/status animations
- `lib/widgets/enhanced_animations.dart` - Additional animation widgets
- Update existing screens to use enhanced animations

### Task 4: Improve Temporary File Cleanup
**Objective**: Optimize file cleanup with better scheduling and error handling

**Details**:
- Implement smart file cleanup based on usage patterns
- Add file size monitoring and cleanup triggers
- Improve error handling in cleanup operations
- Add cleanup progress reporting
- Optimize cleanup scheduling

**Files to Modify**:
- `lib/utils/file_utils.dart` - Enhanced cleanup logic
- `lib/services/file_cleanup_service.dart` - New dedicated cleanup service
- `lib/main.dart` - Improved cleanup scheduling

## Technical Requirements

### Theme Consistency
- All border radius values must be consistent between themes
- Shape properties should match exactly (only colors differ)
- All theme components must be defined in both themes
- No missing theme definitions in Dracula theme

### Performance Targets
- Theme switching should complete in <100ms
- No UI jank during theme transitions
- Memory usage should not increase during theme switches
- App startup time should not be affected

### Animation Requirements
- All state changes should have smooth transitions
- Animations should be configurable/disableable
- No animation lag or stuttering
- Proper animation cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### File Cleanup Requirements
- Cleanup should not block UI thread
- Error recovery for failed cleanup operations
- Configurable cleanup schedules and thresholds
- Progress reporting for long cleanup operations
