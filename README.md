## Troubleshooting

### Android Connection Issues

If you're experiencing connection issues on Android when trying to connect to a remote Ollama instance:

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Connection Failed" or "Connection timed out" errors:**
   - **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure your Android device is connected to the same network as your Ollama server
   - **Verify Server Address**: Make sure you're using the correct IP address and port (not `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` when connecting remotely)
   - **Test Server Accessibility**: Try accessing `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:11434/api/tags` in a web browser on your Android device

2. **Firewall and Network Configuration:**
   - **Server Firewall**: Ensure your Ollama server's firewall allows connections on port 11434
   - **Router/Network Firewall**: Check if your router or network firewall is blocking the connection
   - **Ollama Binding**: Make sure Ollama is bound to `0.0.0.0:11434` (not just `127.0.0.1:11434`)

3. **Android-Specific Network Issues:**
   - **Clear DNS Cache**: Go to Android Settings > Apps > OllamaVerse > Storage > Clear Cache
   - **Network Security**: The app is configured to allow HTTP connections for development
   - **Mobile Data vs WiFi**: Try switching between mobile data and WiFi to isolate network issues

#### Configuring Ollama for Remote Access

To allow remote connections to your Ollama server:

1. **Set Environment Variable** (recommended):
   ```bash
   export OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434
   ollama serve
   ```

2. **Or start with host binding**:
   ```bash
   ollama serve --host 0.0.0.0:11434
   ```

3. **For systemd services**, edit the service file:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl edit ollama
   ```
   Add:
   ```ini
   [Service]
   Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434"
   ```

#### Testing Connection

1. **From your computer**: `curl http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:11434/api/tags`
2. **From Android browser**: Navigate to `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:11434/api/tags`
3. **In the app**: Go to Settings and use "Test Connection"

#### Network Configuration Examples

- **Local network**: `192.168.1.100:11434`
- **Docker**: Ensure port mapping `-p 11434:11434`
- **Cloud server**: Use public IP and ensure security groups/firewall rules allow port 11434

If issues persist, check the app logs in Settings > About for detailed error messages.
